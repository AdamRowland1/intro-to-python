pwd # Prints to the console the path of your current working directory

ls # Lists the files in the directory you are in


cd <directory_name> # Gets in a given directory

cd .. # Gets out of the directory you are in



mkdir <directory_name> # Creates new directory

rmdir my_folder # Deletes an empty Directory (Folder)

When you are done for the day, don't forget to commit and push your work using the git commands:

```shell

git add . # Adds ALL changes to the staging area in preparation for committing them to the repository.â€‹

git commit -m "<Short description of what you have worked on.>" #  Saves changes to the local repository, along with your commit message, usually describing the changes.

git push origin main # Uploads local changes to your remote repository, on the main branch.
```
