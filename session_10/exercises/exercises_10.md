4. Benfordâ€™s law states that the leading digits in a collection of data are probably going to be small. For example, most numbers in a set (about 30%) will have a leading digit of 1, when the expected probability is 11.1% (i.e. one out of nine digits). Fake data is usually evenly distributed, where as real data is not. The files 'accounts_1.txt', 'accounts_2.txt' and 'accounts_3.txt' contain financial transaction data. Work out which of the files contains fake data.
