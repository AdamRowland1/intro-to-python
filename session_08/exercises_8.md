# Session 8 Exercises
All of these questions will use a set of pre-made files with data in.

To easily access these files, create your `homework_8.py` file in the `text_files` folder, but check the `TEST1.py` and `TEST2.py` to see how the path is changed in order to read the `austen.txt` file.

---


## Section A
1. Read the file 'jabberwocky.txt' and print its content to the screen
2. Read the file 'austen.txt' and print the amount of lines in the file
3. Each line of the file 'numbers.txt' contains a number, write a script to add up all the values in the file

## Section B
1. Ask the user to enter their name and append this to a file called 'register.txt'
2. Create a new file called 'even.txt' that contains only the even numbers from the file 'numbers.txt'
3. 'secret.txt' contains a secret message. Each number represents the letter of the alphabet where 1 = A, 2 = B ... Z = 26. Work out what the secret message says
4. Benfordâ€™s law states that the leading digits in a collection of data are probably going to be small. For example, most numbers in a set (about 30%) will have a leading digit of 1, when the expected probability is 11.1% (i.e. one out of nine digits). Fake data is usually evenly distributed, where as real data The files 'accounts_1.txt', 'accounts_2.txt' and 'accounts_3.txt' contain financial transaction data. Work out which of the files contains fake data.
