# What is SDLC?

SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle. It is a structured approach followed in the software industry to guide the development of high-quality software applications. The SDLC consists of a series of well-defined phases that encompass the entire software development process, from initial concept and requirements gathering to final deployment and maintenance.

## Stage 1: Planning And Requirement Analysis

- Perform requirement analysis based on inputs from the customers, sales department/market surveys.

- Conduct product feasibility study in the economical, operational, and technical areas.

## Stage 2: Defining Requirements

- All the requirements for the target software are specified in Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document.

- Get approval from the customers, market analysts, and stakeholders.

## Stage 3: Designing the Product Architecture

- Based on the SRS, design approach for the product architecture is proposed and documented in a DDS - Design Document Specification.

- Evaluate the best design after carrying out risk assessment, product robustness, design modularity, budget, and time constraints.

## Stage 4: Building or Developing the Product

- The actual development starts and the product is built.

- Developers must follow the coding guidelines defined by their organization.

## Stage 5: Testing the Product

- Product defects are reported, tracked, fixed, and retested until the product reaches the quality standards defined in the SRS.

## Stage 6: Deployment and Maintenance Of Product

- The conclusive product is released in phases as per the organization's strategy and is tested in a real industrial environment (UAT testing).

- After the product is released in the market, its maintenance is done for the existing customer base.

# Types of SDLC Models

### Following are the most important and popular SDLC models followed in the industry:​

1. Waterfall Model – Rigid.​

2. Iterative Model – In multiple cycles.​

3. Incremental Model – Bit by bit.​


There are also other models like Spiral Model, V-Model and Big Bang Model.

---

# How to choose the right SDLC?

### There are some rules that the development crew could use to identify the desired SDLC. These include:​

- The size of the crew​.

- Geographical situation​.

- Size of Software​.

- Complication of software​.

- Types of projects​.

- Business strategies​.

- Engineering capability and others where it may be found suitable.

# [fit] The Agile Model
---

# The Agile Model

- It's a combination of the iterative and the incremental process models​.

- Agile Methods break the product into small incremental builds. These builds are provided in iterations.​

- It's an adaptive software development method.

---

# Agile Model - Pros and Cons

## Pros:​

- Early customer involvement​.

- Iterative development​.

- Self-organizing teams​.

- Adaptation to change​.


## Cons: ​

- Not suitable for small projects​.

- Depends heavily on customer feedbacks​.

- Not suitable for handling complex dependencies​.

- More risk of maintainability and extensibility.

# [fit] Building your first project

---

# Task

- Build a Command Line Program using Python.​

- It doesn't have to be complicated, the point of it is for you to create your first project by using the things you learned throughout our lessons.​

- At the end, you should have a functioning program, stored on GitHub, with a README.md file containing its description.

---


# Things to consider

- Respect the project's requirements

- The more challenging your project, the less time you will have to refactor your code.​

- The less challenging your project, the more time you will have to refactor your code.​

- Think of how you can personalise the project so it is unique and an expression of yourself (The language used, ASCII art, etc).

---

# How to build a successful project?

- Be consistent. The more you spend thinking and working on the code, the more solutions and ideas you will have.​

- Keep track of your kanban board and update it regularly.​

- When in trouble, look back to the previous lessons or google your problem. ​

- Try out things and don't be afraid to experiment.​

- Many times when you feel stuck, taking a break from coding is precisely what you need to refresh.

---

# [fit] Programming Principles

---

# Programming Principles

## KISS = Keep it super simple​

- The simpler the code, the easier to understand, remember and refactor.​

​
## DRY = Don't repeat yourself​

- The less repeated elements your code has, the clearer to read and cleaner it will be.

---

# [fit] Kanban

---

# Kanban

## Kanban = Workflow management method.​

- Kanban means "visual board" in Japanese.​

- Helps visualise work, maximize efficiency and  improve continuously.​

- Started in manufacturing, now heavily used by Agile software development teams.​

- Appeared in the late 1940s, as Toyota introduced "just in time" manufacturing to its production --> Production based on customer demand, without generating more costs.
